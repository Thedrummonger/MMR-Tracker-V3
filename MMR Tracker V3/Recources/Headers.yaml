#The tracker will sort location areas in the same order you list them in this file
#Each section is a YAML object with two lists
#The Games list defines what game codes should use this order. If games list is empty or does not exist in the object the order will be used for all games
#The Headers list contains area headers and their order in the list is the order they will appear on the tracker
# a single game can be defined in multiple lists and the order of the list will be taken into account.
