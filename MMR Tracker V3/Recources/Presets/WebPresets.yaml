#Each preset is a YAML object consiting of a Name, Logic and (Optional) Dictionary field
#Name Defines the display name of the preset in the tracker
#Logic is the Web address to the RAW logic file
#Dictionary is the Web address to the RAW Dictionary File. 
#If no dictionary is given the tracker will look for a dictionary in the Recources/Dictionaries Folder
#
#Example:
#- Name: Example Logic
#  Logic: https://pastebin.com/raw/ExAmPlElOgIc123
#
#You can define a custom dictionary for your logic by adding the "Dictionary" line and the link to the dictionary file
#Example:
#- Name: TPR Casual
#  Dictionary: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thedrummonger/MMR-Tracker-V3/master/MMR%20Tracker%20V3/Recources/Dictionaries/TPR%20V1.json
#  Logic: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thedrummonger/MMR-Tracker-V3/master/MMR%20Tracker%20V3/Recources/Presets/DEV-TPR%20Casual.json
