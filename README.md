# MMR-Tracker
An Item, Location, and Entrance Tracker for the Majora's Mask Randomizer

## Basic Functionality:
You will supply this tracker with the logic file used to generate your seed, and it will show you every location that is available to check based on the logic and items you have obtained. Double-clicking a location will prompt you to select what item was found there, or you can import your text spoiler log to have this done automatically. If you know what item a location contains, you can set the location to display what item is located there without actually checking it. All checked locations will be displayed in a separate box, showing the location and item found there.

## Item Settings:
You can customize which locations are randomized, unrandomized, or junk. Unrandomized items will be automatically obtained when they are available, and junk locations will be hidden from the tracker. You can set items as starting items to have the tracker always consider them obtained.

## Entrance Randomizer Features:
When using a version of the randomizer that includes entrance randomization, the tracker will have a separate section to keep track of available entrances. You can also use the pathfinder to show available paths from one entrance to another.

## Extra Features:
The tracker contains a number of tools that are not directly related to tracking.

### Seed Checker
You can use the Seed Checker to check if your seed can obtain a number of selected items based on your logic. You can tell the Seed Checker to ignore certain checks you want to avoid.

### Playthrough Generator
You can use the Playthrough Generator to create a guide that will tell you what items you need to obtain, where they are, and in what order you need to obtain them to beat the game.
